# Contributing to wrec

Wrec's north star is recording efficiency: low memory footprint, low CPU usage,
and clear controls for people and agents. Prefer obvious designs, keep the media
path native, and measure changes that could affect capture overhead.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+ on Apple Silicon.
- Full Xcode selected with `xcode-select`.

If GPUI shader compilation fails, select full Xcode:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

If `metal` still reports a missing Metal toolchain:

```bash
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
```

## Run From Source

During Cargo development, the app and CLI can auto-start the daemon. Building it
once first makes startup a little faster:

```bash
cargo build -p daemon --bin daemon
cargo run -p app
```

Run the CLI from source:

```bash
cargo run -p cli -- targets --json
cargo run -p cli -- record start --target display:1 --duration 30s
```

## Development

Run checks before sending changes:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo check
cargo test
```

The marketing site and benchmark helpers use Bun:

```bash
cd marketing
bun install
bun run format
bun run check
```

Do not use npm, pnpm, yarn, or npx here.

Local recording-path benchmarks live in `benchmarks/`:

```bash
cd benchmarks
bun run bench -- --duration 8s
open index.html
```

## Packaging

Create a local dev app:

```bash
./scripts/package-macos.sh
```

This creates `dist/dev/Wrec Dev.app`, uses the dev Cargo profile, signs the app
ad-hoc, and writes `dist/dev/README.md` with the local build details.

Create release artifacts:

```bash
./scripts/package-macos.sh release
./scripts/package-cli-macos.sh release
```

The app package contains `wrec-app`, `daemon`, and `capture-engine`. The CLI
package contains `wrec`, `daemon`, and `capture-engine`, so it can run without
copying anything out of the app bundle.

Pushing a `v*` tag whose commit is on `main` runs the release workflow and
uploads the `.dmg` and CLI archive to GitHub Releases.
