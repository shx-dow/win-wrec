this is the repository of wrec. the most efficient screen recorder app.
the goal is a screen recorder app which is super super efficient and has very low memory footpring and cpu usage.

Current Status

we are using rust + gpui + a little bit of swift.

thoughts from the author (shivam)
i(shivam,me) want to write this to you(agent). we are building this together.
This is meant to be a bold project. Going with the flow and using existing solutions will not get us where we want to be.

Quick glossary of relevant parties in this document:

you - the agent reading this document and working on wrec directly.
me/we/us - the humans contributing to wrec. This is the party talking to you as we build.
developers - these are our users. We are assuming they won't read code much, rather they will prompt their own agents to build things using wrec.

Here's some philosophical things to consider as we build and work together

## Boil the ocean
When planning, do not be afraid to suggest seemingly insane solutions. we effectively have to rethink and rebuilt the whole pipeline of how screen recorders work. we want the efficiency to be super high with memory and cpu usage being as low as possible. 

## Fight for the "obvious" solution - 

We should avoid being clever and doing things because they seem smart. We want everything we build to be so obvious it feels kind of stupid.
When one of us prompts you, never hesitate to push back and suggest ways we could make things more obvious. Note that "simple" and "obvious" are not always aligned, sometimes the "obvious" solution is more complex.

## Some general rules
These are meant to steer us in the right direction. They are not hard-set, but we should default to following them. If you think one should be ignored, be very loud and clear about that and get approval from us before doing it.
