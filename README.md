Wrec records displays or windows with a native ScreenCaptureKit pipeline, writes
hardware-encoded `.mov` files, and gives you both a small GPUI app and a
JSON-friendly CLI for scripts and agents.

> [!NOTE]
> Wrec is still early public software. The current GitHub release artifacts are
> unsigned dev builds, so macOS will show an unsigned-app warning.

## Features

- Native macOS app built with Rust and GPUI.
- Standalone `wrec` CLI for terminals, scripts, and coding agents.
- Display and window capture.
- HEVC by default, with H.264 available.
- 30 FPS and 60 FPS recording.
- Resolution controls for 720p, 1080p, 2K, 4K, and native capture.
- Cursor capture, system audio capture, and Wrec-window hiding toggles.
- Pause, resume, stop, queued jobs, and recording status.
- JSON output for target discovery, job control, errors, metrics, and logs.
- Local recording history and metrics stored separately from media files.

## Documentation

The full CLI reference, the agent automation contract, and the runtime
architecture live in the docs:

**[wrec-beta.vercel.app/docs](https://wrec-beta.vercel.app/docs)**

## Install

Download the latest macOS app from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/shivamhwp/wrec/releases).

The standalone CLI can be installed with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://wrec-beta.vercel.app/install | sh
```

The CLI installer grabs the release archive for your Mac, installs the runtime
under `/usr/local/lib/wrec`, and places a managed wrapper at
`/usr/local/bin/wrec`.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+.
- Apple Silicon is the primary target.
- Full Xcode selected with `xcode-select`.
- Screen Recording permission for the app or terminal.
- Audio Recording permission when system audio capture is enabled.

If GPUI shader compilation fails during development, select full Xcode:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

If `metal` still reports a missing Metal toolchain:

```bash
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
```

## Run From Source

During Cargo development, the app and CLI can auto-start the daemon. Building it
once first makes startup a little faster:

```bash
cargo build -p daemon --bin daemon
cargo run -p app
```

Run the CLI from source:

```bash
cargo run -p cli -- targets --json
cargo run -p cli -- record start --target display:1 --duration 30s
```

## Runtime Paths

App config and SQLite data:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Wrec
```

Default recording output:

```text
~/Movies/<app name>
```

Daemon files for local automation:

```text
~/.wrec/wrec.sock
~/.wrec/daemon.log
~/.wrec/job-events.jsonl
```

Set `WREC_HOME` to override the daemon directory for tests or isolated agents.

## Development

Run checks before sending changes:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo check
cargo test
```

The marketing site and benchmark helpers use Bun:

```bash
cd marketing
bun install
bun run format
bun run check
```

Do not use npm, pnpm, yarn, or npx here.

Local recording-path benchmarks live in `benchmarks/`:

```bash
cd benchmarks
bun run bench -- --duration 8s
open index.html
```

## Packaging

Create a local dev app:

```bash
./scripts/package-macos.sh
```

This creates `dist/dev/Wrec Dev.app`, uses the dev Cargo profile, signs the app
ad-hoc, and writes `dist/dev/README.md` with the local build details.

Create release artifacts:

```bash
./scripts/package-macos.sh release
./scripts/package-cli-macos.sh release
```

The app package contains `wrec-app`, `daemon`, and `capture-engine`. The CLI
package contains `wrec`, `daemon`, and `capture-engine`, so it can run without
copying anything out of the app bundle.

Pushing a `v*` tag whose commit is on `main` runs the release workflow and
uploads the `.dmg` and CLI archive to GitHub Releases.

## Contributing

Wrec's north star is recording efficiency: low memory footprint, low CPU usage,
and clear controls for people and agents. Prefer obvious designs, keep the media
path native, and measure changes that could affect capture overhead.
