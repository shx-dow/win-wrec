Wrec records displays or windows with a native ScreenCaptureKit pipeline, writes
hardware-encoded `.mov` files, and gives you both a small GPUI app and a
JSON-friendly CLI for scripts and agents.

> [!NOTE]
> Wrec is still early public software. The current GitHub release artifacts are
> unsigned dev builds, so macOS will show an unsigned-app warning.

## Features

- Native macOS app built with Rust and GPUI.
- Standalone `wrec` CLI for terminals, scripts, and coding agents.
- Display and window capture.
- HEVC by default, with H.264 available.
- 30 FPS and 60 FPS recording.
- Resolution controls for 720p, 1080p, 2K, 4K, and native capture.
- Cursor capture, system audio capture, and Wrec-window hiding toggles.
- Pause, resume, stop, queued jobs, and recording status.
- JSON output for target discovery, job control, errors, metrics, and logs.
- Local recording history and metrics stored separately from media files.

## Documentation

The full CLI reference, the agent automation contract, and the runtime
architecture live in the docs:

<a href="https://wrec-beta.vercel.app/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>wrec-beta.vercel.app/docs</strong></a>

## Install

Download the latest macOS app from
<a href="https://github.com/shivamhwp/wrec/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Releases</a>.

The standalone CLI can be installed with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://wrec-beta.vercel.app/install | sh
```

The CLI installer grabs the release archive for your Mac, installs the runtime
under `/usr/local/lib/wrec`, and places a managed wrapper at
`/usr/local/bin/wrec`.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+.
- Apple Silicon is the primary target.
- Screen Recording permission for the app or terminal.
- Audio Recording permission when system audio capture is enabled.

## Runtime Paths

App config and SQLite data:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Wrec
```

Default recording output:

```text
~/Movies/<app name>
```

Daemon files for local automation:

```text
~/.wrec/wrec.sock
~/.wrec/daemon.log
~/.wrec/job-events.jsonl
```

Set `WREC_HOME` to override the daemon directory for tests or isolated agents.

Building from source, development checks, and packaging live in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Wrec's north star is recording efficiency:
low memory footprint, low CPU usage, and clear controls for people and agents.
