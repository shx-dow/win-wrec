```

wrec is a Rust app, standalone CLI, local daemon, and native macOS capture
engine process.

- `crates/app` owns the GPUI window, controls, notifications, and app state.
- `crates/core` defines shared recorder types: settings, targets, sessions,
  metrics, and the recorder engine trait.
- `crates/control` defines the IPC protocol, daemon client, daemon discovery,
  and daemon startup used by both app and CLI.
- `crates/daemon` owns local IPC, one active recording job, queued jobs, and
  shared recording control for the app, CLI, and agents.
- `crates/macos` implements the macOS recorder engine. It supervises the native
  capture-engine process and translates capture output into recorder events.
- `crates/store` writes recording history, events, and metrics to SQLite.
- `crates/macos/native/capture_engine.swift` is the native capture and encode path.

The important boundary is that `app` and `cli` are clients. They do not import
backend, macOS recorder, store, or capture-engine code. They talk through
`control`, and the daemon owns recording state.

At runtime the flow is:

```text
User changes settings in the GPUI app
  -> app submits recording control to the local coordinator daemon
  -> daemon starts one active macOS recorder job or queues the request
  -> macOS engine starts the compiled Swift capture engine
  -> capture engine captures and writes the .mov file
  -> capture engine emits progress/errors/metrics
  -> daemon persists records in SQLite and exposes job state over IPC
  -> app/CLI poll job state and update their UI/output
```

The media path stays inside Apple's native stack:

```text
Rust GPUI app / CLI / agents
  -> control protocol
  -> local coordinator daemon
  -> macOS recorder engine
  -> Swift capture engine
  -> ScreenCaptureKit SCStream
  -> screen frames and optional system audio sample buffers
  -> AVAssetWriter
  -> VideoToolbox hardware video encode + AAC audio
  -> .mov
```

Rust never receives, copies, or retains raw pixels or audio samples. It controls
settings and process lifecycle; the capture engine owns capture, timestamps,
encoding, and finalizing the file.

## Backend

`crates/macos/build.rs` compiles `crates/macos/native/capture_engine.swift` with
`swiftc` into Cargo's build output. At runtime, the Rust backend launches that
compiled capture engine directly. Packaged apps bundle it next to the daemon at
`Wrec.app/Contents/MacOS/capture-engine`; Cargo development falls back to the
capture-engine path emitted by the build script.

The capture engine:

- Lists displays and windows with ScreenCaptureKit.
- Captures screen frames with `SCStreamOutput`.
- Captures system audio with ScreenCaptureKit when enabled.
- Requests NV12 capture buffers where possible.
- Writes real-time video and AAC audio through `AVAssetWriter`.
- Uses HEVC by default, with H.264 available from the UI.
- Excludes Wrec's own process audio from system-audio capture.
- Keeps ScreenCaptureKit queue depth small.
- Drops samples when the writer is backpressured instead of accumulating memory.
- Finalizes the writer deterministically on stop.

Video owns the recording timeline. The capture engine starts the writer session
at the first complete screen frame. If system audio is enabled, audio buffers
are appended with their original ScreenCaptureKit timestamps after the video
session has started.

## UI

The app uses GPUI and `gpui-component` controls.

Current controls:

- Source: display or window.
- Target picker with refresh.
- FPS: 30 or 60.
- Codec: HEVC or H.264.
- Cursor capture toggle.
- System audio capture toggle.
- Preset: efficient, balanced, high. Efficient caps capture at 720p/30 FPS,
  balanced caps capture at 1080p/30 FPS, and high allows native/60 FPS.
- Resolution defaults to 1080p, FPS defaults to 30, and preset defaults to
  balanced.
- Output folder picker.
- Recording status and basic metrics.

Recording-affecting controls are disabled while recording so the UI cannot diverge from the active capture session.

## Reliability

- Recording events are session-scoped so stale capture-engine events do not mutate the wrong recording state.
- The macOS recorder only stops the capture engine on drop when it owns an active session.
- The daemon keeps one active recording job and queues additional requests by default.
- Stop has a timeout and kill fallback.
- Screen Recording permission denial maps to a typed recorder error.
- The Swift capture engine is compiled during Cargo checks/tests, so Swift API breakage is caught early.

## Data

- App config and SQLite data live in `~/Library/Application Support/Wrec`.
- Recordings default to `~/Movies/<app name>`.
- Recording events and metrics are stored separately from the media file so the
  UI can show history and debugging information without inspecting `.mov`
  contents.

## Requirements

- macOS with ScreenCaptureKit support.
- macOS 15+ for the current target.
- Apple Silicon is the primary target.
- Full Xcode selected with `xcode-select`.
- Screen Recording permission granted for the app/terminal during development.
- Audio Recording permission granted when system audio capture is enabled.

## Run

During Cargo development, app/CLI clients can auto-start the daemon through the
workspace. Building the daemon once still avoids the extra Cargo startup work:

```bash
cargo build -p daemon --bin daemon
```

Packaged and installed runtimes resolve the daemon beside the app/CLI runtime.
Alternatively, set `WREC_DAEMON_BIN` to a daemon executable.

```bash
cargo run -p app
```

The terminal client is intended to be automation-first. It uses the same saved
settings as the app, with flags acting as per-run overrides:

```bash
cargo run -p cli -- targets --json
cargo run -p cli -- record start --target display:1 --duration 30s
cargo run -p cli -- record start --app Safari --duration 5m --json
cargo run -p cli -- jobs --json
cargo run -p cli -- job pause <job-id>
cargo run -p cli -- job resume <job-id>
cargo run -p cli -- job stop <job-id>
cargo run -p cli -- daemon stop
```

`list` remains an alias for `targets`, and `record` remains an alias for
`record start`. The CLI now talks to a local coordinator daemon over a Unix
socket so multiple clients can submit work while Wrec keeps one active recording
at a time. Additional requests queue by default; pass `--no-queue` to fail when
another recording is active, or `--detach` to submit and return immediately.
For foreground `record start` commands, Ctrl+C asks the daemon to stop the
submitted job before the CLI exits.

Daemon runtime files are intentionally agent-accessible:

```text
~/.wrec/wrec.sock
~/.wrec/daemon.log
~/.wrec/job-events.jsonl
```

Set `WREC_HOME` to override that directory for tests or isolated agents.

If GPUI shader compilation fails, select full Xcode:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

If `metal` still reports a missing Metal Toolchain, download Apple's Metal component:

```bash
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
```

## Checks

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo check
cargo test
```

## Package

The macOS packaging script has two channels.

Contributor/dev builds are the default:

```bash
./scripts/package-macos.sh
```

This uses Cargo's dev profile and creates `dist/dev/Wrec Dev.app`.
Dev packaging also writes `dist/dev/README.md` with the local open/rebuild
commands and generated build details. The dev app icon is generated from
`images/wrec-dev.png`.

Release builds are explicit:

```bash
./scripts/package-macos.sh release
```

This uses Cargo's release profile and creates `dist/release/Wrec.app`.
Release packaging does not create a companion README. The release app icon is
generated from `images/wrec.png`.

Both channels copy the Rust GPUI app as `wrec-app`, copy the daemon as `daemon`,
copy the compiled Swift `capture-engine`, and sign each executable. Dev builds
use the bundle identifier `app.wrec.wrec.dev`; release builds use
`app.wrec.wrec`.

The standalone CLI runtime is packaged separately:

```bash
./scripts/package-cli-macos.sh release
```

Install it with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shivamhwp/wrec/main/scripts/install-cli.sh | sh
```

Local packaging uses ad-hoc signing by default. Developer ID signing and
notarization can be enabled for release builds with environment variables:

```bash
CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Example, Inc. (TEAMID)" \
APPLE_ID="dev@example.com" \
APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID" \
APPLE_APP_PASSWORD="app-specific-password" \
NOTARIZE=1 \
./scripts/package-macos.sh release
```

Runtime app data lives in `~/Library/Application Support/Wrec`.
Recordings default to `~/Movies/<app name>`.

Pushing a `v*` tag whose commit is on `main` runs the release workflow and
uploads the notarized `.dmg` to GitHub Releases.

## Current Limitations

- Microphone capture is not implemented.
- Output is `.mov`.
- Compression stays AVAssetWriter-managed so disk writing, audio muxing, and
  media finalization remain owned by AVFoundation.
- Pause/resume currently retimes samples after a pause. The next efficiency
  pass is to verify AVAssetWriter session boundaries for pause gaps so we can
  avoid copying every later sample buffer.
- The Swift capture engine is still out-of-process. Packaged builds bundle and codesign it inside the `.app`; replacing it with an in-process native library remains the cleaner long-term shape.
